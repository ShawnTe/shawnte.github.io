<h1>Street art is for everyone</h1>
<p>While traveling the world in my location independent status over the last few years, I've come to love exploring a city through its street art. </p>
<p>Finding maps through Google that people (or the artists themselves) have created, I've had the opportunity to explore neighborhoods far from the tourist book.</p>
<p>The following images are all from my current hometown of Oakland, CA. I've taken all the photos myself.</p>
