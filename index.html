    <h1>Street art is for everyone</h1>
    <p>While traveling the world in my location independent status over the     last few years, I've come to love exploring a city through its street   art.  </p>
    <p>Finding maps through Google that people (or the artists themselves)  have   created, I've had the opportunity to explore neighborhoods far  from the   tourist book.</p>
    <p>The following images are all from my current hometown of Oakland, CA.    I've taken all the photos myself.</p>
    
    <p>But first, a few words from the notorious mystery man himself, Banksy. </p  >
    <blockquote>“Graffiti is one of the few tools you have if you have  almost   nothing. And even if you don't come up with a picture to cure   world poverty   you can make someone smile while they're having a piss.” 
    ― <em>Banksy, Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall</em></blockquote>

  <p>Here's the <a href="http://globalstreetart.com/"> Global Street Art</a> site based in London. My thoughts on this site -- it's image based, which is awesome, especially given the subject matter. There are a ton of images on the home page which can be kinda overwhelming. I like how on the images you can tell whether it's a single image or if there's a link through to an album of images. I also like how you can link through to the artist from the large home page thumbnail. Overall, the site has a clean look and is easy to navigate.</p>
