    <h1>Street art is for everyone</h1>
    <p>While traveling the world in my location independent status over the     last few years, I've come to love exploring a city through its street   art.  </p>
    <p>Finding maps through Google that people (or the artists themselves)  have   created, I've had the opportunity to explore neighborhoods far  from the   tourist book.</p>
    <p>The following images are all from my current hometown of <strong>Oakland, CA</strong>.  <br /><em>I've taken all the photos myself.</em></p>
    
    <p>But first, a few words from the notorious mystery man himself, Banksy. </p  >
    <blockquote>"Graffiti is one of the few tools you have if you have  almost   nothing. And even if you don't come up with a picture to cure world poverty   you can make someone smile while they're having a piss."<br />
    <em>Banksy, Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall</em></blockquote>

  <p>Here's the <a href="http://globalstreetart.com/"> Global Street Art</a> site based in London. <a href="http://globalstreetart.com/"><img src="images/global-street-art.png" alt="Global Street Art"></a>
  <br />
  My thoughts on this site:
  <ul>
    <li>it's image based, which is awesome, especially given the subject matter</li>
    <li>there are a ton of images on the home page which can be kinda overwhelming</li> 
    <li>I like how on the images you can tell whether it's a single image or if there's a link through to an album of images</li>
    <li>I also like how you can link through to the artist from the large home page thumbnail</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Overall, the site has a clean look and is easy to navigate.</p>
